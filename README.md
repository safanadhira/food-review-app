Website Plan : 
This web application allows users to explore restaurants, view available dishes, and share their thoughts through reviews. The core features include:
1. Homepage: A very simple welcome screen that redirects users to the restaurant list.
2. Restaurant Page: Users can add, edit, and delete restaurants. Each restaurant has its own page displaying its food items.
3. Food Management: In each restaurant, users can add or delete food items. Each food links to its own review section.
4. Review System: Users can view existing reviews, create a review, and delete them. Ratings are stored and displayed per dish.
5. Navigation Flow: Every page includes intuitive back buttons.

The project is built with Laravel and Blade, emphasizing modular design and maintainable code.
